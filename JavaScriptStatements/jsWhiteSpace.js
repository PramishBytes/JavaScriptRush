//JavaScript White Space

/*
JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

The following lines are equivalent: 
*/
//let person = "Pramish";
//let person="Adhikari";

//A good practice is to put spaces around operators (=+-*/):

//let x=y+z;

//JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks

/*
For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.
If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to it is after an operator:

*/


// document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 
// 'hello pramish';

//JavaScript Code Blocks
/*
JavaScript statement can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets{...}

The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

One Place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript Functions:
*/

// <!DOCTYPE html>
/* <html>
    <body>
        <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>
        <p>JavaScript code blocks are written between { and }</p>
        <button type = "button"
        onclick = "myFunction()">Click Me!</button>
        <p id = 'demo1'></p>
        <p id = 'demo2'></p>
        <script>
        function myFunction(){
    document.getElementById('demo1').innerHTML = 'Hello Pramish';
    document.getElementById('demo2').innerHTML = 'How are you?' ;}

</script>
