Invoking a Function with a Function Constructor 

If a function invocation is preceded with the new keyword, it is a constructor invocaion.

It looks like you create a new function, but since JavaScript function are objects you actually create a new object: 

//Example

// This is a function constructor: 

function myFunction(arg1,arg2){

    this.firstName = arg1; 
    this.lastName = arg2;
}

// This creates a new object 
const myObj = new myFunction("John","Doe");

//This will return "John"

myObj.firstName;


A constructor invocation creates a new object. The new object inherits the properties and methods from its constructor. 


Note: 

The this keyword in the constructor does not have a value 

The value of this will be the new object created when the function is invoked.
