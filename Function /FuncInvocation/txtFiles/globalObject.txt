The Global Object
When a function is called without an owner object, the value of this becomes the global object.

In a web browser the global object is the browser window.

This example returns the window object as the value of this:

Example

let x = myFunction();            // x will be the window object

function myFunction() {
  return this;
}
//=>NOTE:
Invoking a function as a global function, causes the value of this to be the global object.
Using the window object as a variable can easily crash your program.
