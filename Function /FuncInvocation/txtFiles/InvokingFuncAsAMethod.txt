Invoking a function as a method

In JavaScript, you can define functions as object methods. 

The following example creates an object(myObject),with two properties (firsName and lastName), and a method (fullName)

Example: 

const myObject ={
    firstName:"PRAMISH",
    lastName:"Adhikari",
    fullName: function(){
        return this.firstName + " " +this.lastName;
    }
}
myObject.fullName(); //will return PRAMISH Adhikari


=> The fullName method is a function. The function belongs to the object. myObject is the owner of the function.

This things called this, is the object that "owns" the JavaScript code. In this case the value of this is myObject.

Test it! Change the fullName method to return the value of this: 

//Example: 

const myObject ={
  
  firstName: "Pramish",
  lastName: "Adhikari",
  fullName: function(){
    return this;
  }

}
//This will return [object Object](the owner object)

myObject.fullName();
