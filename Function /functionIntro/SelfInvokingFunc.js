// Self-Invoking Functions

/*
Function expression can be made "self-invoking".

A self-invoking expression is invoked(started) automatically without being called.

Function expression will execute automatically if the expression is followed by ()

You cannot self-invoke a function declaration. 

You have to add parentheses around the function to indicate that it a function expression: 

====>Example: 

(function(){

let x = "Hello!!"; // I will invoke myself

})();

The function above is actually an anonymous self-invoking function(function without name).
